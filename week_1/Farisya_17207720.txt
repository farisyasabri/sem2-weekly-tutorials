My name is farisya with matrix number, 17207720. 
I am majoring in Computer Science. This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject. 
At the moment, I am feeling nervous about taking this subject. 
This is because i love this subject. 

I acquired B for my previous Programming 1 course. It's not so bad. 
So, I think I can manage to get A for the DS subject this term. 
In order to do well in the subject, I will study hard. Wish me luck!!

Thursday, 18 June 2021.        It's me again. Finally, it's the end of the term and the DS class has finished!        I think I did my best in this course. I am so happy thank you :)end
